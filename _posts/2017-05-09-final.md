Ethical Hacking can amount to unlimited and unimaginable opportunities from protecting the United States or building an independently-made self-driving car. Nonetheless, with such power comes the burdening responsibility to uphold ethicality. 
(https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/the-ethics-of-hacking-101/2014/10/07/39529518-4014-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html?utm_term=.e645a6b02b4d) "In a world in which businesses, the military and governments rely on computer systems that are potentially vulnerable, having the ability to break into those systems provides a strategic advantage." To combat the detritments of criminal hacking, multiplatform companies like Google are [hiring researchers](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/15/google-project-zero_n_5589337.html) to find zero-day vulnerabilities before others can exploit them for money.

Solution:
The most promising solution to mitigate the shortage of ethical hacking is to increase the availability of hacking courses. Unviersities such as [Carnegie Melon](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~dbrumley/index.html) and University of Tulsa offer courses teaching the methodologies of software hacking and the faults that exist among revolutionary techonolgy. In reciprocation to such prevelent education, the dichotomous nature dividing hacking and ethical hacking becomes essential. Teaching students how to infiltrate health care databases could quickly produce the crime that ethical hackers are working to defeat. Thus, professors like [Sujeet Shenoi at Tulsa](https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/the-ethics-of-hacking-101/2014/10/07/39529518-4014-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html?utm_term=.e645a6b02b4d) stress the importance of ethical and moral behavior and even vow not to "accept students who donâ€™t promise to work, if hired, for the National Security Agency, the Energy Department or another U.S. government agency." Despite the setback that could potentially add to the hacking dilemma, courses in cyberoffense opens the doors for thousands of wellpaying, needed jobs.

However, a secondary conflict arises as various universities struggle to hire enough qualified staff in not only computer programming but professsors that specialize in hacking. 
Upon further research, I discovered countless websites offerring either free or low-priced packages to teach one of any background to ethically hack. Some packages, such as , even offer certificates for completeing the course. Of course, however, the crediability of such courses offered outside of official institutions is questionable; but just as a person can teach oneself computer coding in the comfort of his/her home, learning how to ethically hack falls under the same feasability. Georgoe Hotz, a [millionaire credited to being the first to hack Apple software](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-george-hotz-self-driving-car/) and eventually recognized as a pure genuis, admits that "he learned most of what he knows on the Internet 'and from playing with things.'" Through self-taught information, Hotz surpassed brilliance to achieve minor, but still impressive, successes such as breaking into Playstation 3 to give the public restricted software, or magnamimous successes such as thought-controlled robots to deep-learning AI.
