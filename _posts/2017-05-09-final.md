(https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/the-ethics-of-hacking-101/2014/10/07/39529518-4014-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html?utm_term=.e645a6b02b4d) "In a world in which businesses, the military and governments rely on computer systems that are potentially vulnerable, having the ability to break into those systems provides a strategic advantage."

Solution:
The  most promising solution to mitigate the shortage of ethical hacking is to increase the availability of hacking courses 
However, a secondary conflict arises as various universities struggle to hire enough qualified staff in not only computer programming but professsors that specialize in hacking. 
Upon further research, I discovered countless websites offerring either free or low-priced packages to teach one of any background to ethically hack. Some packages, such as , even offer certificates for completeing the course. Of course, however, the crediability of such courses offered outside of official institutions is questionable; but just as a person can teach oneself computer coding in the comfort of his/her home, learning how to ethically hack falls under the same feasability.
