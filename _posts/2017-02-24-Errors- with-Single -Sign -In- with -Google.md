Growing up playing video games after school or on the weekends with friends served as a form of escape from reality where I had no responsibility besides trying to reach the final boss at the end of the stage. Growing up gaming delivered many memorable moments such as completing the world in Super Mario in my fastest time, prestiging to a new rank in Black Ops 2, or even crying while I watched as Aerith died in Final Fantasy VII. Gaming during this time was looked down on due to the belief that it promoted violence and acted as too much of a distraction for kids. Enter the age of Esports where people who love to play video games can now making a living doing what they love. The growth of Esports has expanded to now include games such as Halo, Call of Duty, League of Legends, and many more games who are slowly entering this new world of gaming. But is this world the correct path for gaming?

Esports has grown to be recognized as the gaming world’s MLB(Major League Baseball) as it gives gamers a place to do the thing they love while making a proper living. With the usage of twitch, an online streaming software, gaming event’s are able to be viewed by thousands of people while at home. Each year gamers wait for major gaming events that are held so that they can support their favorite organization and players. For those who are not aware of this on growing business may find this hard to believe. To know that you can make money off gaming never was a possibility unless you were the one making it. However, just recently at the last LOL(League of Legends) world championship these athletes played for a prize pool of up to $4million dollars. Even after it was split between the five players and the coaches, that is still a large amount of profit. While this is the larger pool that is played for from players all over the world one might ask where the rest of their profit is coming from to be able to live a proper life. Well, the answer to that is sponsors. Just like athletes get paid by sponsors to promote special items gamers are also receiving these special privileges. For example, large companies like Red Bull, Brisk Mate and Turtle Beach and much more are slowly investing time and money into these gaming organizations to not only promote their items. With such investments, it’s clear to see that they are considered athletes and are treated like such. To make it in this business there are different criteria's that have to be met before you or I can even try to join the world or Esports.Such as having the skills needed, the dedication, and sacrifice. Sound familiar yet? The skill gap between these professional gamers and casual gamers has steadily increased over the years that it is clear to see why many critics are finally considering them as actual athletes.

Now, why is this a curse? Well, many of the games that we once loved are slowly losing the value that they once had. Large gaming companies that make these games are focusing more on trying to make their games for competitive play instead of casual play. Games such as the Call of Duty franchise can be used as a prime example of this change. If one was to compare past games to the current games there is a clear difference in regards to gameplay and game options. Professional Call of Duty players are more heavily involved in giving feedback to the developers so that they can make the game more to their liking. You can argue that they are just trying to make the game better for the future. However, by focusing on a smaller group of gamers instead of the community as a whole means that not everyone will be able to enjoy the games they once loved.

As a gamer, I do cherish the fact that I can now celebrate competitive gaming on a much larger scale. But knowing that I will no longer have a voice is making it harder to accept this growth.
