Growing up playing video games after school or on the weekends with friends served as a form of escape from reality where I had no responsibility besides trying to reach the final boss at the end of the stage. Growing up gaming delivered many memorable moments such as completing a world in Super Mario in my fastest time, prestiging to a new rank in Black Ops 2, or even crying while I watched as Aerith died in Final Fantasy VII. Gaming during this time was looked down on due to the believe that it promoted violence and acted as too much of a distraction for kids. Enter the age of ESports where people who love to play video games can now making a living doing what they love. The growth of ESports have expanded to now include games such as Halo, Call of Duty, League of Legends, and many more games who are slowly entering this new world of gaming. But is this world the correct path for gaming?
