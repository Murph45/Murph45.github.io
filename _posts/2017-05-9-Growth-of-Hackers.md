In the world that we live in hackers are seen as a blemish in society's advancement that will not go away. Hackers have gained a negative image due to their acts of breaking into large companies and releasing private information to the public. Many would argue that hackers need to be locked up and placed in jail for the actions that they commit against the country.  While I agree that their actions are wrong and in some case an act of terrorism against the country I don’t believe they should all be exiled from society as many people want them to be. Hackers to some extent are the heroes in the shadows that the people of this current society need. So instead of trying to eliminate them society should become more aware of them and their actions and slowly adjust to deal with the good and the bad.

To get a better understanding of this situation as a whole it is better to look at specific hackers/hacking groups to see why they should be giving the attention they should have so that they don’t continue to commit these acts. In 2013 Edward Snowden who was working for the CIA at the time released private information about the NSA. This classified information revealed the different global surveillances that the NSA and other intelligence agency were they spied on people's private life without their knowledge. While many people consider him to be a hero due to the fact that he revealed the truth behind what the government is doing. This sparked a huge debate in regards to the balance between what is to be considered national security and instruction of privacy. Others view him as a criminal that betrayed his country because he released private information to the world and ran away to hide in Moscow, Russia. However, what many people agree on is that his actions helped to move the country forward as it forced the country to take a look at the path it was going down. The actions of Edward Snowden not only sparked a change in how the American government interacted with the people but how other countries respective governments started to treat their own people when it comes to their privacy. 

While Snowden's actions sparked a nationwide revision around piracy there were other hacking groups doing similar things but didn’t gain the same recognition on the scale that he did. Hacking groups like Anonymous have gained similar attention in the media for essentially commit acts of “justice” where they attack companies who have done wrong towards the people or society. In recent years they have declared war on ISIS threatening to expose their members to commit terrorist attacks around the world. Additionally, they are also known for hacking into the Pentagon for private information as well. Anonymus are an interesting group to consider when looking at hackers in current society because their intentions are never clear as to what is motivating them and their attacks at the time can go unknown for months before society start to see the impact. As mentioned previously the group have targeted the terrorist group ISIS for their actions. In recent years they have hacked into ISIS websites in where they found information or members, as promised, as well as forcing these cities to the darker side of the web where many people don’t go towards or know how to get to. This is a huge deal due to the fact that the “dark side of the internet” means that it would be harder for the group to organize events and to recruit members. Subtle yet effective in fighting against this group.


The increase in hackers and activities involving hackers can be a good thing in the end because it means that society will continue to evolve in ways that we wouldn’t be able to without hackers finding and exposing faults in our society. Hackers help to reveal the corruption in governments and in large business that would otherwise go unnoticed by others until the damage has been done. This isn’t a justification for them to breach the privacy of people and these companies because at the end of the day it’s wrong to do that. But certain things need to be done that can be considered evil in order to end with a positive outcome at the end of the day. Hackers are doing the dirty jobs that others wouldn’t.

While we have been talking about hackers who have done something in the realm of politics and their contribution to society, good or bad, it is also important to also give attention to hacker groups who focus on technology; technology the thing that is helping society continue to advance at the rate it is now. Technology hackers have gained a negative reputation in the eyes of society because they are known for hacking into twitter accounts, Facebook or even apple could and releasing private information on these people. These are the kind of hackers that I personally don’t support or like that they do because they do it for fun and nothing else as seen past acts. Their motives are to either cause problems for that person or to gain global attention but do nothing with it. These are the group of hackers that I personally feel have given hackers a worse name than what was already established. These are the types of hackers that I feel society should seek to eliminate. The only good these groups have done towards society is help larger companies improve their cyber security of their devices/websites which means people private information is truly secured. Once apple’s cloud storage was breached they rewrote the code which made it harder to hack to the point that the FBI couldn’t gain access to one of their phones.

Overall, I feel that hackers come in different forms with different intent based on their targeted field. This article is meant to help bring awareness to the growth in the activities of hackers and to show how society in some cases need them in order to advance. Not all heroes wear capes.
