Harvard University, claimed to be the [second best establishment](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/harvard-university-2155) for higher education in the United States, 

As technology is catalyzing plagiarism... are universities efficiently adapting to the increasing feasibility of plagiarism?

Allegheny College operates under its [Honor Code](http://sites.allegheny.edu/deanofstudents/student-conduct-system/academic-conduct/honor-code/), a juridical system that clarifies itself "different than those of many other colleges because it is a student code, developed and upheld by the students themselves rather than imposed by the College administration."
"The College assumes that the integrity of each student and of the student body as a whole will be upheld. A primary responsibility of each student is the maintenance of honesty in one’s own academic work. In addition, it is the moral obligation of each student to help maintain the integrity of the entire College community." Directly in its policy, the Honor Code board "assumes" that students 

Under this definition, the responsibility to uphold academic integrity is fundamentally placed on the students.
Allegheny also relies on its students to be the eyes that report Honor Code violations, and the committee motivates observers to report violations by stating that failing to act on the observed plagiarism "is as injurious to the honor of the College community as is the observed act of dishonesty and constitutes an infraction of the Honor Code." 

Is plagiarism a self-acknowledged and peer-reported act of dishonesty? Or, should school executive boards have more involvement to prevent and punish academic disintegrity?


According to Section 4 of Allegheny College's policy, "A student, when submitting a test or paper, shall sign their full name in signature." However, while initially appearing that the college itself universally applies this requirement, Section 4 continues to explain that "each professor may determine how their students will recognize the pledge." The lack of an omnipresent rule of requireing a signature creates a gray area among how this suggested policy is upheld. From my educational experience at Allegheny, I have observed that each professor does in fact have his/her own implementation of the Honor Code policy. While some professors demand a signature for each test and paper, other intructors neglet the policy entirely and never ask for signatures. Thus, the gray area around the Honor Code creates an individual, subjective experience for each student concerning plagiarism. Not only does this policy disrupt a communal definition for submitting one's own work but creates the dilemma that some students can get away with plagiarizing while others face violation consequences. If a student is found suspicious of academic dishonesty, the [Faculty Handbook](http://sites.allegheny.edu/deanofstudents/faculty-guide-to-the-honor-code/) states that "the instructor may choose to withdraw the complaint or forward it to the Dean of Students Office." While it is logical for the instructor to take part in the process of identifying plagiarism, the professor should not be the initial reliability to repremend a student as it defeats both reliability and validity of the Honor Code; the Faculty Guide for the Honor Code, a document that should unambiguously require all professors to follow a strict plan in response to plagiarism, simply "encourages" instructors to inform students about their individualistic ruling against citations. There are endless opportunities for personal bias to corrupt both the student's education about plagiarism and the repremands that would follow if suspicion of academic dishonesty arises.

Objection: Encouraging academic honesty as an individual choice of morality without the threat of higher authority creates an intrinsic motivation to belong in such... 
But, if this is effective, why is plagiarism on the rise?
Yet is it necessarliy true that ? Is it always the case, as I have been suggesting, that ? 
Of course, many may disagree on the grounds that
On one hand, I agree with individuals that . But on the other hand, I still insist that 

Technology is one of the largetst factors in the increasing plagiarism epidemic, and, while more and more sites to steal essays continue to pop up, universities should simultaneously improve plagiarism prevention through education. Analyzing Harvard's scandel, Harvard president [Drew Gilpin suggests](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/08/college-announces-investigation/) that "there is work to be done to ensure that every student at Harvard understands" its community's values of academic dishonesty. Concerning Allegheny College, not only increasing education is essential but also removing ambiguity from its Honor Code and implementing a universal ruling for all professors to enfore such Code. Although whether Allegheny College's Honor Code sucessfully mitigates plagiarism is debatable, the foundation behind educating students about the school's policy, implementing methodologies to prevent dishonesty, and punishing those that plagiarize should not be subjective; simply assuming that students will abide by a code ran by fellow classmates and relying on a professor's individual interpretation of the Honor Code is not effective. 
At first glance, universities may assume that leniency inspires personal academic integrity. But on closer inspection, the various loopholes among an Honor Code lacking overarching authority depletes the credability of its purpose. As the Harvard scandal exemplifies, the progressive development of technology
