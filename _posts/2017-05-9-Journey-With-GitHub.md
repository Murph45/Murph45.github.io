Throughout the process of publishing articles, I would have to say that I found my experience with GitHub and Markdown to be an easy and simple technique to use in order to learn the skills needed. As someone with zero background teaching or knowledge in making a website, it was easy for me to learn the different commands and steps to take to create the website as well as customizing it to fit my liking. Having the ability to publish your articles on a public local server I found to be one of the best things that came along with this trend because it allowed me to see a preview of how the “live” version of the article would be. Additionally, through GitHub, it allowed for me to edit/ revise someone else's work from the source itself instead of having to use a third part. However, the only negatives of using Markdown and GitHub would be the constant need to push and commit certain files that didn’t push correctly; small issue and easily fixable but sometimes a hindrance.


When doing presentations through Github and Reveal.js it was helpful that it allowed me to easily transfer it onto my mobile-ready website so that people could read my article as well as seeing a slide to go with it. Additionally, it gave is more control over the presentation as a whole in regards to how detailed we were able to customize each slide individually or through other methods. On the other hand, I found this process to be longer and in some situations more tedious to do than creating a presentation on Google Slides or through Prezi. Sometimes a single mistake like erasing a letter of the code itself would result in your slides not displaying themselves correctly.Another example would the pictures on a slide is too large or too dark that the text is hard to read properly. Overall, it was an interesting skill to use and to learn but a tedious task that I don’t find myself using in the future for the reasons explained above.
