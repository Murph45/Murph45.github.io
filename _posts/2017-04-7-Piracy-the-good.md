In today's day and age, technology is at the forefront of society ever growing advancement. However, while it does present us with positive it also brings a lot of negatives that as well. In this article, I will present to you the weakness in the rapid growth of technology that many people have overlooked; piracy the act of stealing or is it.

Piracy is the act of infringement copyright and stealing the valuable work whether it means stealing music, movies, books, applications from the internet. To many, the act of committing piracy for some is seen as a game to see how much things they can essentially get an away with before getting caught. In this underground world of illegal transactions, there are two main groups of people who help this market continue to grow and prosper. The first group is what most people fall under, the user/independent pirate, those who will go to their local theater to record the movie of their choice. Then either sending a proper copy of the rip film, usually changing it to the proper file, to friends of keeping it for themselves. The user is the most common group that most people fall under due the fact that it incorporates anyone who downloads pirated items from the internet. A poll from YouGov showed that a total of 32% of adults have used pirated items from the internet.

The second group of people within this underground "business" has gained the name of "The Scene" a community of people who are adept in the distribution of pirated materials. The difference between the casual pirates and those involve in this group is that these are the people who are responsible for for the pirated networks. Scene groups help to create networks such as Pirate Bay and other torrent sites to help distribute a copy of the new music, movies, games software or any other products. They are essentially the people responsible for running the major piracy websites tat are used today in today's generation. You may be wondering how these websites are able to continue to stay online if they are supporting illegal actives? Well, the answer is in clear site but yet hidden at the same time.

To get a better understanding of what I am referring to we must first revisit the site that was the leading website for pirating up until 2014; that website is pirate bay. Pirate bay was started in 2012 as a form of file sharing website through the means of torrents. The traffic on the website began to grow until it started to grow into a larger network to share pirated items. It was not until 2014 that the third creator of the website, Fredrik Nei, was arrested while trying to flee the country. With the arrest of all three original founders, the website was able to be finally shut down. Well, that was until the website was re-uploaded again by someone who had the needed files to do so. A report made by the Washington Post explains that another outside source was able to recover the archives of the deleted website and restored it.

Restore isn't quite right because the newly reformed website changed the methods of which they distribute the pirated items for users. The original pirate bay worked with torrents which meant that the items were placed in a file for users to download directly from the website. However, with this newer revamped version of pirate bay, started to use magnet links/magnet torrents which will lead the user to another link to download the torrent that way. By using Utorrent or another torrent downloading software the user is able to download the pirated item which is hidden until extracted by the torrent download software of the user choice.


However, just understanding how these websites work doesn't properly explain why people commit piracy and why some people don't. Which is why I decide to interview two people who have past encounter with pirating to get their opinions on the matter. In order to protect their identity, we shall know them as Mac and Tobi.Here is how that interview went:

What is your opinion on pirating do you consider it to be a good or a bad thing?

Mac: Well the met answer to that question is that it does negatively impact the economy because instead of properly buying the item of choice, we [piraters] are simply getting a copy of it.

Tobi: Well I don't see pirating as a bad thing honestly. While I do agree with what Mac is saying I don't fully agree with it. I see pirating as a good. It helps people to develop better software to make it better. For example, downloading the newer Photoshop software will help developers make it harder for pirates to leak their products. Similar to how Adblock works advertisers are developing new ways to get around Adblock every day.

Are you openly honest with your piracy?To friends who may or may nor do the same?

Mac: I wouldn't use the word openly but in a more subtle manner. We would share pirated software or music or whatever that we have with each other. All while in secret [laughter] its not like we go outside and scream who wanted pirated movie of whatever new hot movie is out.

Tobi: [laughter] Mac couldn't have said it better but what I would like to add is that piracy has become such a big part of this generation that it became a norm. So we wouldn't have to share it through the means of USB or email. A friend can ask where I got a movie from and I can simply pass him the information on how to get it.

Mac: Essentially helping to grow the community without leaving a criminal trail if you will [laughter]

How old were you started pirating?Do you remember what it was?

Mac: I was around the age of 14 years old, god know what year that was, but I do remember that I did download the Mac miller best day ever album.

Tobi: I started younger at around 11 years old. Ok while it does sound young I only did it to play ROM hacks which are essentially free games that we would use emulators. Bet you can't guess which game it was.

Mac: Pokemon it had to be because that was the most popular ROM hack during that time period. And it still is..or rather yet was because Nintendo shut down the websites

Tobi: Yea that's true but gaming piracy isn't targeting as much because when you pirate games you don't always get every aspect of the game

-Do you still play these pirated games-

Tobi: Once in awhile because even though I can't play the actual games on my computer, without going through shady websites there are still fan made pirated games, sticking with Pokemon for example, that are still fun.

Mac: As long as the internet continues to live on there will always be a way.

How were you introduced to piracy?

Mac: My friend told me where I can go to get the things I needed and that essentially allowed me to enter into the world of piracy.  From turning youtube videos into mp4 files. That is something I believe everyone has done at least once.


Tobi: Oh 100% Youtube videos back them were essentially tutorials on how to get pirated items They were encouraging it without knowing it.


Who do you think should exist?

Mac: The people who commit the pirating should be blamed because they are committing the “crime”. And I think Tobi would agree that the producers of the software or the music should be blamed as well because of how the market their products.

Tobi: I could pay $60 for a new subscription to adobe but it'll only end up crashing or something going wrong with it. So why pay for it if I'm essentially getting a faulty product for my money.


Do you think piracy helps to spread, software, music, the item?

Mac: Yes, absolutely that was what pirate bay and other websites did before it was taken down

Tobi: That's especially true when it comes to music. I can download the newest Drake album before it drops and I play it for my friends who can go out to buy it. Or even yet convince them to g buy it after hearing it and all they would know is that I bought it and shared it with them.

Why do you think pirating has continued to live on?

Mac: The cost of this software continue to rise so people will continue to pirate the products

Tobi: People like the challenge of outdoing the developers. It's a constant game or cat and mouse. They take down a website another one gets put right back up like nothing happened.

Have you ever considered not using pirated software?If you have stopped what made you?

Both: Yea but it cost too much{laughter}

Do you truly consider internet piracy to be the crime?

Tobi: It is a crime but it's a crime that has a reason as to why people continue to commit it. Everyone has a different reason from money, to looking cool having something another person can't {Mac: that's just human desire to be better than the next person}. But if it was truly a crime the government would have shut it down completely.

Mac: Or maybe the government is committing piracy themselves

What would you say to someone who doesn’t approve of piracy?

Tobi: It's not a drug that once you start you'll be addicted. But the reason that piracy exist is that people realize a better way to distribute items and that's it. And I can say that everyone has used some sort or pirated product in their lifestyle. So don't judge those who commit piracy because you might be criticizing yourself.

Mac: Have had fun paying for your college textbooks {laughter}

What I learned from this interview is that piracy is a choice people use to get something that they may or may not have access to. But more importantly, people who do commit piracy are still humans and accept the fact they are doing something that many might find illegal. But yet this lifestyle continues to live on despite society's rapidly increasing disfavor towards it.

So I ask which side of the argument are you on?Are you someone who support pirated websites and those who partake in it or are you someone who looks down on them? In the end, no matter which side you choose doesn't define who you are but it does define where your support will go in this never ending the struggle.
