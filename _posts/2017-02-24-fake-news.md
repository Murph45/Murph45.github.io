During the 2016 presidential race, virtually every online news source was under attack of fake news. Credible news sources including The Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian, and the Gannett publications have come under fire for publishing false information, and many have responded with plans to reorganize, fire employees, and kill off entire sections. Falling under the same heat is the very company that allows billions to trust in its omnipotent platforms. Although not the first company to come to mind when discussing news, Google is in no way above the flood of fake news. After the national vote in November, the top result when searching "final election numbers" was a fraudulent, elementary blog reporting what the author noted as "news" with a headline as such: "Final election 2016 Numbers: Trump won both Popular(62.9 M-62.2 M) and Electoral College votes(306-232)." Not only was the headline both misleading and starkly false, the author defended his inaccurate numbers by stating he obtained his information from someone named "Michael" from twitter; to the rest of the world interested in who won the presidential election, it would have been "Michael" from twitter reporting erroneous data.
