During the 2016 presidential race, virtually every online news source was under attack of fake news. Credible news sources including The Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian, and the Gannett publications have come under fire for publishing false information, and many have responded with plans to reorganize, fire employees, and kill off entire sections. Falling under the same heat is the very company that allows [billions to trust in its omnipotent platforms](http://www.popsci.com/google-has-7-products-with-1-billion-users). Although not the first company to come to mind when discussing news, Google is in no way above the flood of fake news. After the national vote in November, the top result when searching "final election numbers" was a fraudulent, elementary blog reporting what the author noted as "news" with a headline as such: "Final election 2016 Numbers: Trump won both Popular(62.9 M-62.2 M) and Electoral College votes(306-232)." Not only was the headline both misleading and starkly false, the author defended his inaccurate numbers by stating he obtained his information from someone named "Michael" from twitter; to the rest of the world interested in who won the presidential election, it would have been "Michael" from twitter reporting erroneous data. While the recent election fostered thousands of fake news articles striving after attention and controversy, Google has a long history with false news breaking through their algorithm. 

In recent years, Google has seen advancements in policy, implementation of software, and the creation of new features to combat fake news. In current development, Google deleted the "In The News" feature that would appear at the top of desktop and mobile devices promoting current articles concerning the searched topic. While this feature often highlighted pressing and controversial news, "In The News" would also promote personal blogs, Reddit threads, and the election results that "Michael" from Twitter reported. The error was found in its allowance for any site to be featured as bona fide content. For example, even with safeSearch on, googling “TSA” brought up the Reddit thread ["F@ck You, TSA,”](http://searchengineland.com/googles-news-listings-beyond-traditional-205213) a thread simply bashing the TSA, as information that was “in the news." Although Reddit can discuss controversial topics that appear in the news, the site cannot be verified as a news source to the slightest degree. While the actual Google News platform efficiently uses credible news sources and denies Reddit, "In the News" posed a great threat to misinforming the population for it was the first content users would see when conducting a Google search; contrastingly, Google News requires users to click on its header after the initial search results pop up. Thus, Google logically removed the faulty feature and put more effort into improving Google News. In 2016, the company [advanced its “Fact check”](https://blog.google/topics/journalism-news/labeling-fact-check-articles-google-news/) that will only allow headlines verified by one of the hundred sources for fact-checks and containing the schema.org ClaimReview markup.

Understandably, Facebook is facing this dilemma at a higher extreme, but it must not be forgotten how much greater Google’s platform is than the social media website. Google's chief business officer, Phillip Schindler, recently responded to the recent influx of fabricated articles at the [Code Media conference](http://www.recode.net/2017/2/14/14619384/google-fake-news-problem-facebook-code-media) in 2016: “We have to take the fake news problem very, very seriously and think about what we can do there.” Schindler contributes such increase of fake news to the abuse of Google's AdSense platform where there is much opportunity to make money. In addition to adjusting policies to combat false information from taking spotlight, Google has drastically increased its rate of removing sites in violation of its advertising policy. The number from 2015 to 2016 jumped from [780 million to 1.7 billion](http://www.recode.net/2017/1/25/14375750/google-adsense-advertisers-publishers-fake-news) in correlation with its improved technology to detect offending ads. Under its current ad policy, Google directly prohibits false reporting: listed on its [Prohibited Content policy](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1348688?hl=en#Misrepresentative_content) is “Content that enables dishonest behavior," such as false identities and documents, and "Misrepresentative content," such as promoting deceptive products or services.

So how do fake articles keep slipping through? 

Recently, Google's search engine boosted a [Metro UK article](http://metro.co.uk/2016/12/06/aliens-are-sucking-energy-from-the-sun-and-ufo-fans-caught-one-on-camera-6304917/) reporting video footage of a UFO sucking energy from the sun. A post that believes a "spherical alien craft seems to be hoovering up energy  – possibly before turning its beams on Earth," was the [top result](http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13877308/google-fake-news-aliens-loch-ness-monster) for a general search of "aliens" prompted by Google's new implementation of AMP (accelerated mobile pages) sites. Ridding of the "In The News" feature, Google's mobile application lists [AMP articles](https://www.ampproject.org/learn/about-amp/) at the top of the search page in effort to clean up the results and promote urging news relating to the search. Thus, when energy-sucking aliens appear as an AMP article, there is blatant evidence that Google is still struggling to keep non-credible sources from top results even after retracting "in the news" and redesigning its features.
