•    The consequences of plagiarism over time I feel has diminished in the eyes of society. Some might argue that over time fewer people are committing plagiarism, which is why plagiarism has seemingly no longer given as much attention as it once did. They would argue that the current system to prevent plagiarism is known by everyone, even though it differs from the person’s location it still essentially does the same thing. However, this is not true because, in reality, the consequences of plagiarism is not the same for people I other countries as well as those who are in the same country but share different standings in such said country. With the addition of technology, it only became worst due to the fact that there are new ways of committing plagiarism that is intact harder to track. Only revealing the errors in this “norm’ of plagiarism when it comes to the academic standards. 
    In most high schools the punishment for plagiarism differs based on the school’s location and how severe the act is if a punishment is needed in the first place. These punishments would include but are not limited to suspensions, a rework of the plagiarized assignment (or the plagiarized section) to no punishment given and the student is let off the hook. Many people, myself included, have witness at least one of these consequences happen to a fellow student or to themselves. While the examples of consequences might be common in the states that don't mean it's common in other countries who have different standards when it comes to plagiarism. In a survey made by Donald McCabe, a former professor at Rutgers University, found that out of the 24,000 students across 70 different high schools “58% admitted to committing some form of plagiarism” [http://www.plagiarism.org/resources/facts-and-stats/ ]. Another interesting statistic he found from this work was that “One out of three high school students admitted that they used the Internet to plagiarize an assignment” s[http://www.plagiarism.org/resources/facts-and-stats/ ]. These statistics reinforce the fact that plagiarism is still a common thing that happens in our society, it has not gone away but instead has become harder to identify. While we don’t know if these students were dealt a consequence and the level of the consequence but the fact that more than half of the total number of students have committed the act of plagiarism.
