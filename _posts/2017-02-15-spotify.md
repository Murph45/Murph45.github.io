It is 2:15 am on a Tuesday in November and the rain is just beginning to let up on Philly streets. With shaking hands and tired eyes, I watch the neon lights flicker above me as adrenaline from the hours before still runs through my veins. Despite the two-hour drive home and eight am classes the next morning, I patiently wait to have a conversation with the individuals 

From that night in 2012, it became clear the unlimited possibilities that came along with downloading the app. Although requiring a paid subscription to listen ad-free and restriction-free, Spotify provides an infinite library of songs without the overwhelming pressure to spend money and purchase the music through Itunes or Amazon music. Throughout the years, various music apps developed into money-hungry companies more concerned abut ads for an insurance company than the music itself. However, Spotify only continues to expand its capabilities and improve quality without increasing membership prices. Today, the software creates a new playist each week impressively tailored to every individual user with new music for the user to discover. This "Discover Weekly" playlist not only highlights the intricacy in its internal programming but also shows me that this app knows me greater than most acquintances in my social life. Spotify continuously builds upon its user's interaction rather than stagnating its functions and appeal; thus, it creates an infinite atmosphere of worldly music discovery. 

Since its creation, the Internet continuously fosters a place of community and interactivity. Among such a place are platforms that were created to encourage and inspire creativity beyond the average day-to-day interactions. Particularly, Spotify is a connected platform for any popular or up-and-coming artist to share music that listeners throughout the world can access with a tap of the finger. Billboard magazine sums the app as "the place fans discover music as well as consume it." Through both the app and desktop domain, I discovered over 2,000 new artists that propelled my fascination for music even further. After downloading the app I became completely enveloped Spotify brought me to hundreds of shows and various cities along the entirety of the east coast; I've seen more of the country through concert tickets and song lyrics than possible before. The app has effortlessly become an essential part of my dailiy routine. It is now a habitual nature of mine to scroll through the years of saved music while concurrently stumbling upon hidden songs from favorite artists. Everyday is filled with new melodies that seem to shape the atmosphere around me.
