With the rapid growth of technology and the need for multiple sign in information it's important to have a central connection for multiple accounts. This connection will ensure that all of our private information remains secure and protected. Which is why Google's single sign in function is honestly a helpful thing to have because through the click of a button all of our accounts can be linked together. This eliminates the need for multiple account passwords, as well as eliminating the need to constantly re enter information for a new sight. However, if something was to go wrong with their system it would throw everyone's normal life into chaos. The reason I say this is because as mentioned previously technology is constantly changing and growing, as such the possibility of someone finding a way to breach the privacy coding created by Google is impossible. For example, the likes of Yahoo and Apple, giant corporations who were once believed to  have the strongest defense against hackers,have been hacked in different times throughout history. This forced them to revisit their privacy defenses as well as having to deal with regaining the trust of the people that got hacked into.

Note this article is not meant to discourage you from using google single sign in function or to convince you to  unlink accounts that you already have set up.
