With the rapid growth of technology and the need for multiple sign-in information, it's important to have a central connection for multiple accounts. This connection will ensure that all of our private information remains secure and protected. Which is why Google's single sign-on function is honestly a helpful thing to have because through the click of a button all of our accounts can be linked together. This eliminates the need for multiple account passwords, as well as eliminating the need to constantly re-entering information for a new sight. However, if something was to go wrong with their system it would throw everyone's normal life into chaos. The reason I say this is because as mentioned previously technology is constantly changing and growing, as such the possibility of someone finding a way to breach the privacy coding created by Google is impossible. For example, the likes of Yahoo and Apple, giant corporations who were once believed to have the strongest defense against hackers,have been hacked in different times throughout history. This forced them to revisit their privacy defenses as well as having to deal with regaining the trust of the people that got hacked into.

The idea of google getting hacked does sound like a crazy thing to happen but in reality, it’s not impossible. Just recently an article published in New York Times technology section by Vindu Goel and Nicole Perlroth discuss how 1 billion accounts were hacked into. Resulting in users losing access to their email address and their information that is linked to that specific account. This hack, as the article explained, was greater than the hacking that had happened a couple of years ago. After the initial hacking, of course, their services got improved but the fact that they were still hackable, proved that they were still vulnerable in the end. This article proves that google at some point will be targeted for a cyber attack.     

Note this article is not meant to discourage you from using google single sign in function or to convince you to unlink accounts that you already have set up. The warning relates back to another “underlying” feature of this function that stores all of our information. What makes the single sign-in system is that websites will take important information like address, birthdays, and anything else that is needed and that is saved to the google database, and will autofill it for another website you are signing into. This overall makes the process faster and quicker but what many people don’t understand is how much information that they are giving up. The autofill aspect of google single sign in function if breached would be handing over your identity to another person. Which is why when using this function that one makes sure that the website is secured and is a trusted website.

If I were to guess most people use maybe 1 of 2  groups of passwords throughout their lives. Only to make minor changes to them but still in the range for them to remember. It is advised that you change your password every 6 months to help prevent hacking. However, this won’t protect your accounts if you did use google single sign-in, it's meant to protect other forms of hacking. Also, it may as well do protect your account.
