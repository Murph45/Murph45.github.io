  The consequences of plagiarism over time I feel has diminished in the eyes of society. Some might argue that over time fewer people are committing plagiarism, which is why plagiarism has seemingly no longer given as much attention as it once did. They would argue that the current system to prevent plagiarism is known by everyone, even though it differs from the person’s location it still essentially does the same thing. However, this is not true because, in reality, the consequences of plagiarism is not the same for people I other countries as well as those who are in the same country but share different standings in such said country. With the addition of technology, it only became worse due to the fact that there are new ways of committing plagiarism that is intact harder to track. Only revealing the errors in this “norm’ of plagiarism when it comes to the academic standards.

  In most high schools the punishment for plagiarism differs based on the school’s location and how severe the act is if a punishment is needed in the first place. These punishments would include but are not limited to suspensions, a rework of the plagiarized assignment (or the plagiarized section) to no punishment given and the student is let off the hook. Many people, myself included, have witness at least one of these consequences happen to a fellow student or to themselves. While the examples of consequences might be common in the states that don't mean it's common in other countries who have different standards when it comes to plagiarism. In a survey made by Donald McCabe, a former professor at Rutgers University, found that out of the 24,000 students across 70 different high schools [“58% admitted to committing some form of plagiarism”](http://www.plagiarism.org/resources/facts-and-stats/).Another interesting statistic he found from this work was that [“One out of three high school students admitted that they used the Internet to plagiarize an assignments"](http://www.plagiarism.org/resources/facts-and-stats/). These statistics reinforce the fact that plagiarism is still a common thing that happens in our society, it has not gone away but instead has become harder to identify. While we don’t know if these students were dealt a consequence and the level of the consequence but the fact that more than half of the total number of students have committed the act of plagiarism.
  However, this act doesn’t only stop at a high school level but expands into college and even to Grad school. Each having different rules established to deal with any situation based on plagiarism or anything in that realm. While many people want to believe that plagiarism doesn’t happen at this level of education because they do have the harshest punishment for committing plagiarism. The punishment that spans the range of getting fined thousands of dollars, getting expelled from the school or even having all credit from your work [past or present] be questioned for other acts of plagiarism. In a society where a person status is considered the end all be all of their worth to have your work no longer be taken seriously can cause other hindrances. Overall, what I am saying is that even at the highest level of education plagiarism is still a thing that is still happening but in a way that it’s not easily punished due to the fact that people are not looking for it.

  With the constant evolution of technology, there are new ways to commit plagiarism without another person finding out. The article that I would like to focus on is the article called the “The Shadow Scholar” by Ed Dante which tells the story of a professor who writes papers for students over the internet. What this shadow scholar essentially did was charge students an undisclosed amount of money to write their paper for them. What stood out to me the most about this article is that he said “You know what's never happened? I've never had a client complain that he'd been expelled from school, that the originality of his work had been questioned, that some disciplinary action had been taken. As far as I know, not one of my customers has ever been caught.” This article is quite an interesting read because it gives an insight into the life of a person who is essentially helping students by helping the committee plagiarism. He goes on to essentially justify his reasons on the grounds of helping people graduate as well as the fact that he's getting paid to do it by working alongside the client at the time.

  After reading this article and doing other outside research I have come to believe that the problem with plagiarism in our society is not that people no longer care about it but instead are finding it difficult to identify it. As mentioned previously as technology continues to expand and grow and more answers to our problems become available to us from the internet. The harder it will become to not only detect but to tell the difference when it comes to original and a fake. Additionally, the error within the system, in the end, is that people no longer fair getting caught for plagiarism because of people like the shadow scholar. Which is why I suggest that in order to counter this problem society should revise what it means to commit plagiarism now that it's in an age of technology. Others would argue that this won’t stop the problem as people would find another way around the new plan and this pattern will only continue. Plagiarism has become a part of our society. While that idea is true by revising the understanding of plagiarism on ethical level people will slowly stop committing plagiarism acts thus slowly eliminating it from society.

  By essentially creating a culture against plagiarism the act will slowly no longer exist, which is the ideal result, but what will most likely happen is that people will slowly realize it's not worth the risk in plagiarizing if it is such a big deal again.
