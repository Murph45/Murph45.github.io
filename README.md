# Beautiful Jekyll
This repository contains the Markdown and HTML source code for Jamie Myers' website. The webiste utilizes the Beautiful Jekyll template that is mobile-ready, customizable, and easily accesible. 

## Build a mobile-ready website in simple steps

### Fork this repository

(Assuming you are on this page and logged into GitHub) Fork this repository by clicking the *Fork* button on the top right corner. Forking means that you now copied this whole project and all the files into your account.

Once you have forked the repository, install necessary packages by typing "bundle install -- path ~/.gem" in terminal and proceed after packages have finished installing. 

Once packages have intalled, type "bundle exec jekyll serve" into terminal to transform Markdown into HTML. If running, you can access your website locally by typing http://127.0.0.1:4000 into web browser.

### Rename the repository to `<yourusername>.github.io`

This will create a GitHub User page ready with the **Beautiful Jekyll** template that will be available at `http://<yourusername>.github.io` within a couple minutes.  To do this, click on *Settings* at the top (the cog icon) and there you'll have an option to rename.

### Customize your website settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site. To edit the file, click on it and then click on the pencil icon. Any line that begins with a pound sign (`#`) is a comment, and the rest of the lines are actual settings.

After you save your changes to the config file (by clicking on *Commit changes* as the video tutorial shows), your website should be ready in a minute or two at `http://<yourusername>.github.io`.

Your website is at `http://<yourusername>.github.io` (replace `<yourusername>` with your user name). 

## Add your own content

To add pages to your site, you can either write a markdown file (`.md`) or you can write an HTML file directly.

Many personalization settings in `_config.yml`, such as setting your name and site's description, setting your avatar to add a little image in the navigation bar, customizing the links in the menus, customizing what social media links to show in the footer, etc.


## Credits 
As the Beautiful Jekyll template was used, the oringal credits of the template are preserved.

"This template was not made entirely from scratch. I would like to give special thanks to:
- [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) and his project [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), from whom I've taken several ideas and code snippets, as well as some documenation tips.
- [Iron Summit Media](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia) and their project [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog), from which I've used some design ideas and some of the templating code for posts and pagination.

"I'd also like to thank [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io/), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and another [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllrc.github.io/jekyllthemes/) for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories."

If you do fork or clone this project to use as a template for your site, I would appreciate if you keep the link in the footer to this project.  I've noticed that several people who forked this repo removed the attribution and I would prefer to get the recognition if you do use this :)
